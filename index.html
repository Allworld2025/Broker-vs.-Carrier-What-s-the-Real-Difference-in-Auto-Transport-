      <h2>Understanding the Basics</h2>
      <p>When it comes to shipping your car, the terms <strong>broker</strong> and <strong>carrier</strong> often create confusion. Let's break them down and see how a trusted company like <strong>AmeriFreight</strong> fits in.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Who is a Carrier?</h2>
      <p>A <strong>carrier</strong> is the company that physically transports your vehicle from point A to point B. These are the ones behind the wheel—handling the actual logistics of loading, moving, and delivering your car.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Does a Broker Do?</h2>
      <p>A <strong>broker</strong>, on the other hand, acts as a matchmaker between customers and carriers. They coordinate transport, manage paperwork, and ensure your vehicle is matched with the best-rated, available transporter.</p>
    </section>

    <section>

        <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Brokers like AmeriFreight streamline the process so you don't have to call multiple carriers.</li>
        <li><strong>Peace of Mind:</strong> Brokers handle communication, paperwork, and problem-solving.</li>
